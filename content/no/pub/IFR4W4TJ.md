    SignificanceTomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) infection causes severe losses in tomato yield worldwide. Lack of information on resistance ( R ) genes against ToLCNDV has considerably retarded the pace of crop improvement against this rapidly spreading pathogen. Here, we report an effective defense strategy deployed by a resistant tomato cultivar against ToLCNDV. It employs Sw5a (R gene) that recognizes AC4 protein (viral effector) of ToLCNDV to restrict virus spread. At the transcriptional level, the sly-miR159-SlMyb33 module has been identified as governing gene expression of Sw5a. Thus, we provide a mechanistic insight into sly-miR159-SlMyb33–controlled Sw5a-mediated defense response in tomato against ToLCNDV. These findings could be translated into development of resistance in susceptible cultivars of tomato through modern breeding or molecular approaches.
Several attempts have been made to identify antiviral genes against Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) and related viruses. This has led to the recognition of Ty genes ( Ty1-Ty6 ), which have been successful in developing virus-resistant crops to some extent. Owing to the regular appearance of resistance-breaking strains of these viruses, it is important to identify genes related to resistance. In the present study, we identified a ToLCNDV resistance ( R ) gene, SlSw5a , in a ToLCNDV-resistant tomato cultivar, H-88-78-1, which lacks the known Ty genes. The expression of SlSw5a is controlled by the transcription factor SlMyb33, which in turn is regulated by microRNA159 (sly-miR159). Virus-induced gene silencing of either SlSw5a or SlMyb33 severely increases the disease symptoms and viral titer in leaves of resistant cultivar. Moreover, in SlMyb33- silenced plants, the relative messenger RNA level of SlSw5a was reduced, suggesting SlSw5a is downstream of the sly-miR159-SlMyb33 module. We also demonstrate that SlSw5a interacts physically with ToLCNDV-AC4 (viral suppressor of RNA silencing) to trigger a hypersensitive response (HR) and generate reactive oxygen species at infection sites to limit the spread of the virus. The “RTSK” motif in the AC4 C terminus is important for the interaction, and its mutation completely abolishes the interaction with Sw5a and HR elicitation. Overall, our research reports an R gene against ToLCNDV and establishes a connection between the upstream miR159-Myb33 module and its downstream target Sw5a to activate HR in the tomato, resulting in geminivirus resistance.
