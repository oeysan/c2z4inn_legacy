    Objective: To assess the predictive effect of a multidisciplinary 
intervention programme, pain, workrelated 
factors and health, including anxiety/depression 
and beliefs, on return-to-work for patients 
sick-listed due to musculoskeletal pain. 
Design: A randomized clinical study. 
Methods: A total of 284 patients were randomized 
to either a multidisciplinary intervention programme 
(n=141) or to a less resource-demanding brief 
intervention (n=143). Work participation was estimated 
monthly from register data for 12 months. 
Return-to-work was defined as increased work participation 
in 3 consecutive months. 
Results: In the adjusted model, return-to-work by 3 
months was associated with a multidisciplinary intervention 
programme (odds ratio (OR)=2.7, 95% 
confidence interval (95% CI)=1.1–6.9), the factor 
“belief that work was cause of the pain” (OR=2.2, 
95% CI=1.1–4.3), anxiety and depression (OR=0.5, 
95% CI=0.2–0.98), and by an interaction between 
the multidisciplinary intervention and perceived 
support at work (OR=0.3, 95% CI=0.1–0.9). At 12 
months, only duration of sick leave was associated 
with return-to-work (OR=0.6, 95% CI=0.5–0.8). 
Conclusion: Multidisciplinary intervention may hasten 
return-to-work and benefit those who perceive 
low support at work, but at 12 months only duration 
of sick leave at baseline was associated with returnto-work.
