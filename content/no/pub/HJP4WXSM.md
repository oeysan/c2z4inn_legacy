    Introduction: Involving people with lived experience of mental distress in mental health nursing education has gained considerable traction yet broader implementa- tion remains ad hoc and tokenistic. Effective involvement requires curricula be in- formed by lived experience of service use. 
Aim: To develop standards to underpin expert by experience involvement in mental health nursing education based on lived experience of service use. 
Methods: Phase one used qualitative descriptive methods, involving focus groups with service users (n = 50) from six countries to explore perceptions of service user involvement in mental health nursing education. Phase two utilized these find- ings through consensus building to co-produce standards to support Experts by Experience involvement in mental health nursing education. 
Results: Three themes emerged in Phase one: enablers and barriers, practical and informational support, and emotional and appraisal support. These themes under- pinned development of the standards, which reflect nine processes: induction and orientation, external supervision, supportive teamwork, preparation for teaching and assessing, “intervision,” mutual mentorship, pre- and post-debriefing, role clarity and equitable payment. 
Conclusions: These standards form the framework entitled; Standards for Co- production of Education (Mental Health Nursing) (SCo-PE [MHN]). 
Implications for Practice: The standards aim to support implementation of Expert by Experience roles in mental health nursing education.
