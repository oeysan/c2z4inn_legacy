    Most refugee parents experience uncertainty and loss transitioning to a new society. In this situation, the family is ascribed an increased value, as a social capital and a point of reference in an unstable world. At the same time, the complexity of the new society creates new hierarchical structures that place the family in a vulnerable position. Educational institutions like kindergartens and schools play a major role in the lives of families, since their practices impact the wellbeing and prospects for the future of the children. This chapter explores how newly arrived refugee parents perceive their interactions with kindergartens and schools in their new context. Data is collected by observations in a group of refugee parents over one year and by individual interviews, using interpreters. The study shows that there are good intentions on both sides, but the complexity of the situation causes misunderstandings, thus creating new instances of uncertainty. There is, however, a good potential for improved communication and better understanding in the relationship between refugee parents and kindergartens and schools.
