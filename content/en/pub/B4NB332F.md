    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    Physical activity in the presence of nature can lead to additional, more distinct mental health benefits such as lower stress and anxiety levels and an overall better psychological state when compared to indoor physical activity. Interestingly, the brain mechanisms underlying the effects of green exercise (GE) and virtual green exercise (VGE) on psychological responses are hitherto under-researched. The present study sought to deepen our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying the effects of GE and VGE during self-paced walking. Thirty individuals took part in the present study. Two experimental (i.e., GE and VGE) and a control condition (CO) were administered in a randomized and counterbalanced order. Participants were asked to walk for Â¼ mile at a pace of their choosing and self-report their psychological states at various timepoints during the exercise trials. Heart rate variability and the brain's electrical activity were monitored continuously throughout the experimental protocol. An accelerometer was used to identify the beginning and end of each step. The results indicate that both experimental manipulations were sufficient to influence the majority of psychological and psychophysiological parameters. The most pronounced effects were identified for GE when compared to CO and VGE. VGE was also sufficient to evoke positive emotions and partially reallocate attention externally, although such effects were less pronounced than those observed for GE. The brain mechanisms underlying the abovementioned psychophysiological responses may be associated with significant changes in theta activity throughout the cerebral cortex as well as increased connectivity in the frontal and parietal areas.
