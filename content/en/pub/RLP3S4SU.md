    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    Per- and polyfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) are classified as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and known to be protein bound. The aim of the present study was to determine the levels of 17 different PFASs before and one year after bariatric surgery, and to assess whether weight loss and changed serum protein concentrations could be influencing factors. Plasma samples from 63 patients were analyzed for nine perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), three perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs), and five perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide based substances (PASF) before and after surgery. Protein determination was performed in the corresponding serum samples. Mean weight loss one year after surgery was 32.1 kg. The plasma levels of all PFASs decreased with 4–34% compared to preoperative values, and included perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA), and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), which have been identified with increasing levels in the general population during recent years. Serum protein concentrations also decreased with 7–8%. Although protein levels were positively correlated with PFOA, PFBS, PFHxS and PFOS, regression analysis revealed that neither weight loss nor reductions in concentrations of serum protein could explain the decreased PFAS levels. The type of surgical procedure did not influence the changes of PFAS levels between the two sample points. A reduced food intake and alterations in absorptions of nutrients after bariatric surgery may have influenced the observed decreasing plasma levels of PFASs.
