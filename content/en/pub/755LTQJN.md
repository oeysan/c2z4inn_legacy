    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    Background:It is argued that breakdown of β-amyloid in the brain causes deposition of senescent plaques and therefore Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One of the influential factors for increasing level of this protein is exposure to lead. Our aim was to compare blood lead levels (BLLs) between patients with AD and healthy controls. Methods:This case–control study was performed on all patients with cognitive impairment who were referred to the Neurological Clinic of Birjand in 2016 to 2017. Patients were referred to the laboratory for measurement of their serum levels of lead. The controls and patients were matched by age and sex. Results:In the AD case group, the average BLL was 22.22 ± 28.57 μg/dL. Mann-Whitney U test showed that BLLs were significantly higher in the patients than in the controls. The unadjusted odds ratio for BLL among the patients was 1.05 (95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.09; P = .01) compared to the controls. Conclusion:In the present study, BLL was associated with AD.
