    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    The chelating thiols dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) and dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS) are effective 
in enhancing urinary excretion of mercury and lead. However, strategies for mobilization of toxic metals 
from aged brain deposits may require combined use of a water soluble agent, removing circulating metal 
into urine, as well as lipophilic chelator, being used to facilitate the brain-to-blood mobilization. Pb(II) 
and Hg(II) ions are coordinated with DMSA through one ACOOH and one SH group. However Pb(II) 
can bind with racemic DMSA through two SH groups in non-aqueous solvents (when ACOOH groups 
are esterified). Generally, such Pb(II) and Hg(II) complexes have a composition of 1:1 and 1:2. 
However, binuclear and polynuclear species with DMSA like 2:1, 2:2, 2:3, 3:3 have been identified for 
Hg(II) ions. Both Pb(II) and Hg(II) ions are formed with BAL 1:1 and 1:2 complexes with coordination 
through two mercapto groups. Early experiments showed promising results with the SH–dextran–Briti 
sh anti-lewisite (BAL) combination. Later insight indicates that the DMPS–BAL could be preferred in cases 
of long-term Hg exposure. In cases of lead poisoning DMSA has been the recommended antidote due to 
its low toxicity. However, DMSA is distributed extracellularly, and its efficacy might be improved when 
combined with a brain-to-blood shuttling agent. Thus it has been found that the ionophore Monensin can 
improve its effect by increasing the egress of intracellularly deposited Pb. Previously, BAL was combined 
with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in severe cases. Today, it is reasonable that low-dosed BAL 
can facilitate mobilization of Pb from brain to blood during DMSA-treatment
