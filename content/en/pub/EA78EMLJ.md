    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    Background: Human food subsidies can provide predictable food sources in large quantities for wildlife species 
worldwide. In the boreal forest of Fennoscandia, gut piles from moose (Alces alces) harvest provide a potentially 
important food source for a range of opportunistically scavenging predators. Increased populations of predators can 
negatively affect threatened or important game species. As a response to this, restrictions on field dressing of moose 
are under consideration in parts of Norway. However, there is a lack of research to how this resource is utilized. In 
this study, we used camera-trap data from 50 gut piles during 1043 monitoring days. We estimated depletion of gut 
piles separately for parts with high and low energy content, and used these results to scale up gut pile density in the 
study area. We identified scavenger species and analyzed the influences of gut pile quality and density on scavenging 
behavior of mammals and corvids (family Corvidae). 
Results: Main scavengers were corvids and red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Parts with high energy content were rapidly 
consumed, mainly by corvids that were present at all gut piles shortly after the remains were left at the kill site. Corvid 
presence declined with days since harvest, reflecting reduction in gut pile quality over time independent of gut pile 
density. Mammals arrived 7–8 days later at the gut piles than corvids, and their presence depended only on gut pile 
density with a peak at intermediate densities. The decline at high gut pile densities suggest a saturation effect, which 
could explain accumulation of gut pile parts with low energy content. 
Conclusions: This study shows that remains from moose harvest can potentially be an important food resource for 
scavengers, as it was utilized to a high degree by many species. This study gives novel insight into how energy content 
and density of resources affect scavenging patterns among functional groups of scavengers.
