    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    1. Sustainable harvest management implies an ability to control harvest rates. This is 
challenging in systems that have limited control of resources and resource users, 
which is often the case in small game harvest management. The difference between 
management strategies and actual harvest bag size (i.e. implementation uncertainty) 
may be substantial, but few studies have explored this. 
2. We investigated how different management strategies and ecosystem variables affected 
realised harvest of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus L.) among nine independently 
managed, state-owned 
hunting areas in Central and South Norway 
during 2008â€“2015. First, we focused our empirical analysis around three response 
variables of interest: hunting bag (scaled by area), hunting effort (number of hunting 
days scaled by area) and hunter efficiency (shot birds per hunting day). Akaike information 
criteria (AIC) guided model selection among candidate GLMMs. Then, we 
used model-averaged 
parameter estimating from the statistical models in numerical 
simulations to explore risk of overharvest due to implementation uncertainty. 
3. The most parsimonious model explaining hunting bag included total allowable catch 
(TAC) and willow ptarmigan density. Hunting effort was explained by number of permits 
sold and type of quota (daily vs. weekly quota). The most parsimonious model 
describing hunter efficiency only included the effect of willow ptarmigan density. 
4. Our results show that managers have only partial control over harvest rates in this 
system, and that hunters were relatively more efficient and harvest rates higher at 
low densities. This effect was present for all management strategy scenarios, 
including 
when managers adjusted TAC according to population estimates from 
monitoring programmes. 
5. Synthesis and applications. Quantifying risk of unsustainable harvest rates under different 
scenarios enables managers to make informed decisions, when dealing with 
competing objectives of harvest opportunities and sustainability. The substantial 
risk of high harvest rates at low densities reported here should encourage frequent 
use of threshold strategies. This study is one of the first approaches for quantifying 
implementation uncertainty in small game harvest, and shows how estimates from 
empirical analyses could be used to quantify risk of overharvest.
