The estimation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in 
Agenda 2030 is based on available abstracts from publications and is calculated
using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers 
([BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model))). The models are 
developed by Vanderfeesten et al. 
([2022](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6487606)) and can be downloaded from 
Jaworek ([2022](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5835849)).
